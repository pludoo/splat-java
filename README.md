## About Splat

This is a very small framework developed in Java to use as a base for a BugTracker.

Here's why this is such a good framework:
* Lightweight with minimal code, not stuffed with extra features
* Enables easy expansion
* All code is commented for easy understanding

The "Main.java" file contains a few examples of code to get you started. Feel free to reach out to me if you feel the need to ask any questions.
